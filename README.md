# ElectroGrid

About the project
ElectroGrid (EG) is the company who maintains the power grid of the country. The number of stakeholders of EG is growing and the current system is not scalable. They have a system to monitor the power consumption of the users, generate the monthly bills and automatically send to the users, and accept the online payments from the users. Our task was to develop a highly scalable online platform for the EG to cater all the users. The platform is simple and easy to understand.
